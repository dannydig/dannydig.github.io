         <h3>FINAL PROJECT</h3>
         <div>
             <p>
                 You turn in a document which looks like a completed research paper, which is ready to be submitted to a conference.
             </p>
             <p>
                 You incorporate the feedback you received on M4 in class (plus you write the text for the Empirical Evaluation section 
                 that you presented at M4), and add new sections:
             </p>
             
            <ul>
                 <li>By now you should have a working solution. Take your previous document from Milestone 4, and add 2-3 pages describing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>ABSTRACT:</h5>
                            This should be punchy, intriguing, and stirring the interest of the reader to read the whole paper. 
                            You can achieve these goals by following the 
                            <a class="urllink" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OneStartlingSentence" rel="nofollow">Startling Sentence</a>
                            pattern.

                        <li>
                            <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
                            This should be a 1-2 page summary of the whole paper. It contains:
                            <ul>
                                <li>the higher-level motivation for the work (e.g. the importance and urgency of the problem you are trying to solve),</li>
                                <li>a brief description of the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art, the challenges that your solution must address.</li>
                                <li>a brief description of your solution</li>
                                <li>a brief description of the empirical evaluation and its main results</li>
                                <li>an explicit list of the contributions</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <h5>RELATED WORK</h5>
                            We require at least 10 references. You need to compare and 
                            contrast your work to previous work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
                            This is a brief summary, but also contains the most surprising 
                            findings, implications, directions for future research.

                            <h5>LESSONS LEARNED</h5>
                            This is where you write a brief retrospective of your experience on working on the project in CSCI 7000-025 Spring 2020. 
                        
                        In this Section please discuss some of these Reflections points:
(1) what went well in the project and in the future you should more off
(2) did not go so well, in the future you should change
(3) what still puzzles us.
                        </li>
                        When you write this final project report make sure that the whole paper reads cohesive, like it's written by one author (instead of a committee), 
                            so you will need to smoothen the transition between the previously written sections, etc.
                    </ul>
            </ul>
