        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                You will prepare and deliver two presentations from the assigned papers.
                The presentation should go beyond the content of the papers themselves, 
                as you can assume that we all read them. For example, as part of your 
                presentation, you can prepare a hands-on activity that demonstrates the 
                key concept in the paper(s), show relevant videos, develop thought-provoking 
                discussion questions, or expand the material of the papers (e.g., explain related 
                techniques, offer a more thorough description of the problem, or report your 
                own analysis of using the tool or technique described in the paper).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The presentations will be scored based on these criteria:  </p>
                <ul><li>(30 points) Presentation of the content. Did you accurately and effectively 
                        communicate the most interesting ideas in the paper? </li>
                <li>(30 points) Value added to the content. Did you offer insights, activities,
                        content, or anything else that went beyond the content of the paper? </li>
                <li>(20 points) Effectiveness of the presentation materials. How well did you
                        structure, organize, and design your materials?</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                You will also receive 20 points credit for moderating & generating live open discussions using your own critique but also critique questions that you received from your colleagues.
            </p>
