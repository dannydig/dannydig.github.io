        <h3>TEXTBOOK</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Selected research papers will be available online through ACM or IEEE Digital Library, or through ArXiV.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Students should have basic knowledge of Computer Science undergrad classes, including software engineering, programming languages, systems, ML/AI as demonstrated by undergrad courses at CU. This is <b> NOT </b> an introductory grad course to Software Engineering, for those students we recommend other grad courses such as Foundations of Software Engineering (CSCI 5828). This course assumes you are a competent software engineer already -- we are looking into how you can augment your current skills to include GenAI supported software development.  
               If you are not sure whether you can attend this course, please consult the instructor (email: danny.dig@colorado.edu)</p>

            <p>Attendance is mandatory. Five or more unexcused absences will result in failure 
            of the course. Excused absences include University-related travel (e.g., to 
            attend an academic conference), job interviews, and illness; but please notify 
            me beforehand or as soon as possible.</p>

        <h3>NO LAPTOP POLICY -- for when class is held in person on Campus</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Several studies and anecdotal experience shows that laptops are a distraction in the classroom - they disrupt learning, lower the performance of 
            students who use them, and even distract the other students. Here is an article that discusses some of the issues: 
            <a class="urllink" href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368" rel="nofollow">article1</a>, 
            <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?np=y" rel="nofollow">article2</a>. 
            Students may not use laptops, 
            cell phones, or other electronic devices in this classroom. If you expect this will pose an undue hardship for your learning, please speak with the professor.

        <h3>SPECIAL NEEDS</h3>
        <div>
            <p>If you have any special needs (e.g., medical conditions), please come and talk directly with the professor.
