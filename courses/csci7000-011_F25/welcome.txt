Dear students in Sw Dev for IoT grad course,

I am Prof Danny Dig, and I am excited to teach the class on Software
development for IoT Systems (CSCI 7000-008). I am looking forward to
seeing you this Tue on Zoom for our first day of class. I was so looking
forward to meet you in person but this has to wait until CU resumes
classes in person.


We are doing a few things differently from other classes that you took
in the past, so please pay attention to the instructions for this first
week of class. Also notice that in order to be enrolled and be
successful in this class, you need to have a good foundation of computer
science. The prerequisites are the core undergrad CS classes or a solid
experience of industrial software engineering (or experience in various
application fields for IoT). If you are not sure about any of these,
please  speak with me after the class.


ABOUT THE COURSE
The purpose of this research course is to expose students to seminal
topics and recent trends in the field of IoT.

A new era in computing is emerging, marked by the digitalization and
connection of many aspects of the physical world. Coupled with advances
in AI, highly-connected computing sparks a technological revolution
rivaling the industrial revolution in breadth of impact. The next big
growth in IoT systems will come from pushing pervasive personalized
intelligence to the edge of the network, where latency is critical, and
mobility, privacy, and context awareness are essential qualities of the
application. This will enable an entirely new class of applications by
generating business intelligence that is predictive instead of reactive,
thus making processes more efficient and saving time, energy, and money.

In this highly interactive, Seminar-style class featuring
Instructor-guided exploration and student-led discussions, we will be
investigating (i) innovative use of IoT software systems (compelling
applications) and (ii) the research technical thrusts that enable the
exciting applications of the future. Our exploration will consist of
in-class discussions of the literature, interactions with industry
thought leaders, and team projects that encourage risk taking.

The course will offer an opportunity for students to pursue
research-oriented or novel industrial term projects in small teams (2-3
students). Students may pursue any project of their choosing that
explores the intersection of IoT systems with one of the following
thrusts: ML/AI, Edge Computing, SE, PL, Security/Privacy, Human Factors.

The course will offer several opportunities for interactions with the
movers and shakers in IoT from industry and government research labs.
Prof Dig will facilitate discussions with industry executives that are
partnering with the PPICenter.org headquartered at CU, led by Prof Dig.
The class will also feature live discussions with the key industry
thought leaders from the IoT World, the largest IoT industry tradeshow
in the world.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

- expand student's knowledge more broadly about IoT research & practice through reading research papers and industry surveys
- develop critical thinking abilities by being able to assess the quality of published research and pose new research questions
- practice giving scientific presentations and teaching others
- engage in active learning activities in class, such as student-guided discussions on research and applications for IoT
- practice developing a research or novel-industrial software development project through all its stages: formulating a research problem, posing research questions, gathering related work, designing a solution, evaluating the solution empirically, writing a research paper
- practice engaging in dialogue with C-level executives from the various IoT verticals (smart transportation, precision ag, smart manufacturing, digital health, etc).
- have fun learning


Some logistics for the first week of class. The first class
will be held this Tue, Jan 11 from 2-3:15pm on Zoom 
(VIP: you need to login with your CU Boulder credentials on Zoom):
https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/96670974495 

Here are some items for you to accomplish right after the first
class:

1) Read course syllabus (and other info) on the class webpage.
Our course webpage contains a wealth of information, including how to
communicate with the staff and other colleagues (e.g., through Piazza),
readings schedule for the first meetings, etc:
https://danny.cs.colorado.edu/courses/csci7000-008_Sp22/

2) Since we will read and discuss several research papers in this class
(we will read and conduct research and novel development on IoT), read this excellent resource on 
how to Read an Engineering Research paper (by William Griswold):
http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html

3) Sign up on Piazza:
http://piazza.com/colorado/spring2022/csci7000008
After this email, all the communication will be on Piazza.


Looking forward to seeing you in class this Tue.
