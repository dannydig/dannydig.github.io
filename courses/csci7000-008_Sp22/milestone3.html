              Milestone 3 ...              
              </p>
             <p>
                 During this Milestone you present the plan for experimental evaluation of your solution and your results. 
                 Convince your colleagues, the professor, and potential conference reviewers that your solution 
                 works, i.e., your solution effectively solves the problems that you listed in the motivation section.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Structure your 10-minute presentation to include the following items:
             </p>
             <ol>
                <li><h5>MILESTONE 3</h5>
                Make sure you explicitly list the research questions. Have specific questions, 
                rather than generic questions. For example, if you built an amazing tool, 
                Eradicator, a question such as "Is Eradicator useful?" is too vague. Instead, 
                you should design some specific questions that answer the usefulness from 
                different angles: how does Eradicator improve programmer productivity, software 
                quality, what is its running time, is it scalable, etc.
                </li>
                <li> <h5>EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY</h5>
                 Here you present the setup of your experiment, the corpus of the data that you plan to use to 
                 answer the research questions, any procedures that you will follow, etc.
                </li>
                <li> <h5>RESULTS</h5>
                 Think about the format in which you will present your results.

                 <ul>
                     <li>What are the surprising/unexpected results?</li>
                     <li>What are the outliers?</li>
                     <li>What did you learn?</li>
                 </ul>
                  
                You will also present in class your current progress. Cover the same points like in the previous bullet, you could even do a demo. 
                Plan to talk for about 10 minutes.
                 </li> 
             </ol>
         </div>

        <h3>HAND-IN:</h3>
        <p>
            Each team should submit, the PDF and the Presentation Slides (PDF preferred, or PowerPoint), in Canvas, before the class (by 12pm) on TBA.
        </p>
        <h3>NOTES:</h3>
        <p>
        The 
        <a href="./finalProject.html">Final Project</a>
        report document (due during the Finals Week) will include a section titled Empirical 
        Evaluation. When you will add this section, make sure that you use the same structure 
        that you used for the M3 and M4 presentations (outlined above). Also, in your final document, 
        incorporate the feedback you received during previous Milestones, and the feedback you 
        received in class for M3 and M4.
