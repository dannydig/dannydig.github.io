    <h3>ABOUT THE COURSE</h3>
    <div>
        <p>The purpose of this research course is to expose students to seminal topics and recent
        trends in the field of IoT.   

<p> A new era in computing is emerging, marked by the digitalization and
connection of many aspects of the physical world. Coupled with advances
in AI, highly-connected computing sparks a technological revolution
rivaling the industrial revolution in breadth of impact. The next big
growth in IoT systems will come from pushing pervasive personalized
intelligence to the edge of the network, where latency is critical, and
mobility, privacy, and context awareness are essential qualities of the
application. This will enable an entirely new class of applications by generating business intelligence that
is predictive instead of reactive, thus making processes more efficient and saving time, energy, and
money.

       
       <p> In this highly interactive, Seminar-style class featuring Instructor-guided exploration and student-led discussions, we will be investigating 
        (i) innovative use of IoT software systems (compelling applications) and (ii) the research technical thrusts that enable 
        the exciting applications of the future. Our exploration will consist of in-class 
        discussions of the literature, interactions with industry thought leaders, and team projects that encourage risk taking.
        </p>
        <p>The course will offer an opportunity for students to pursue research-oriented or novel industrial
        term projects in small teams (2-3 students). Students may pursue any project of
        their choosing that explores the intersection of IoT systems with one of the following thrusts: ML/AI, Edge Computing, SE, PL, Security/Privacy, Human Factors.
        </p>
        <p>The course will offer several opportunities for interactions with the movers and shakers in IoT from industry and government research labs. Prof Dig will facilitate discussions 
        with industry executives that are partnering with the <a href="https://ppicenter.org">PPI Center</a> headquartered at CU, led by Prof Dig (e.g., see a sample of our <a href="https://hopin.com/events/ppi-center-scale-up#speakers">current partners</a>). 
        The class will also feature live discussions with the 
        key industry thought leaders from the <a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/iot-world/">IoT World</a>, the largest IoT industry tradeshow in the world.
    <h3>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h3>
        <ul><li>expand student's knowledge more broadly about IoT research & practice through reading research papers and industry surveys
        </li><li>develop critical thinking abilities by being able to assess the quality of published research and pose new research questions
        </li><li>practice giving scientific presentations and teaching others
        </li><li>engage in active learning activities in class, such as student-guided discussions on research and applications for IoT
        </li><li>practice developing a research or novel-industrial software development project through all its stages: formulating a research problem, posing research questions, gathering related work, designing a solution, evaluating the solution empirically, writing a research paper
        </li><li>practice engaging in dialogue with C-level executives from the various IoT verticals (smart transportation, precision ag, smart manufacturing, digital health, etc).
        </li><li>have fun learning 
        </li></ul>

    <h3>SCHEDULE</h3>
    This is a tentative schedule to give you an idea of the topics that we study in the class. Some of the assigned papers are likely to change based on the projects that students work on, once we finalize the list of course projects.
