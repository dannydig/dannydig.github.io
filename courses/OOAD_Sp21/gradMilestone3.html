                    <h1>Grad Project Milestone 3: Results Update</h1>    
                        <p> This page is intended only for the Grad Students in the class (i.e., people registered for the CSCI 5448, sections 001 or 003). 
                        Make sure that you first familiarize yourself with the two Tracks, Industry-novel and Academic-novel, for the grad project (read <a href="./projectTracks.html">Project Tracks</a>).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                 Unlike the previous milestones, the deliverables for this one is a presentation only. You will 
                 have a little more time (until Finals week) to submit the final document for your whole project.
             </p>
             <p>
                 During this Milestone you present the experimental evaluation of your solution and your results. 
                 Convince your colleagues, the professor, and the staff that your solution 
                 works, i.e., your solution effectively solves the problems that you listed in the motivation section.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Structure your 4-minute presentation to include the following items:
             </p>
             <ol>
                <li><h5>Research Questions</h5>
                Make sure you explicitly list the research questions. Have specific questions, 
                rather than generic questions. For example, if you built an amazing tool, 
                Eradicator, a question such as "Is Eradicator useful?" is too vague. Instead, 
                you should design some specific questions that answer the usefulness from 
                different angles: how does Eradicator improve programmer productivity, software 
                quality, what is its running time, is it scalable, etc.
                </li>
                <li> <h5>EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY</h5>
                 Here you present the setup of your experiment, the corpus of the data that you used to 
                 answer the research questions, any procedures that you followed, etc.
                </li>
                <li> <h5>RESULTS</h5>
                 Here you present the results using graphs, charts, etc. You also interpret the results, 
                 highlight some of the scenarios where Eradicator did very well, but also those where 
                 Eradicator did not do well. You can show examples of corner cases where Eradicator did 
                 not do well and possible explanations. When you present the results, in addition to 
                 simply showing graphs and charts, you need to address these questions:

                 <ul>
                     <li>What are the surprising/unexpected results?</li>
                     <li>What are the outliers?</li>
                     <li>What did you learn?</li>
                     <li>If you plan to add more data until the Final Submission, where will you get this new data?</li>
                 </ul>
                  
                You will also present in class your current progress. Cover the same points like in the previous bullet, you could even do a demo. 
                Plan to talk for about 4 minutes.
                 </li> 
             </ol>
        </div>
       
       <h3>HAND-IN:</h3>
        <p> Each team should submit the submit a PDF version of the Presentation (you can use PowerPoint, OpenOffice, or Keynote, but please convert them to PDF) addressing the points in the templates above. 
        Submit the PDF on Canvas, <b>before 1PM on 04/16</b>. 
                        Afterwards, the professor will load all presentations on his laptop. 
                        Students will have <b>four minutes</b> on class on Friday (03/19) to present their project on Zoom (while the professor will share the slides from his laptop - this will eliminate valuable time lost in switching screen sharing on Zoom). 
                        For students who are not attending the live session of the class, please post the link to your self-recorded 4-minute video on the front page.
        <p> Only one student from your whole team needs to submit in Canvas, and make sure that you list the name of everyone in the team on both PDFs.                          

        <h3>NOTES:</h3>
        <p>
        The Final Project
        report document (due before the Finals Week) will include a section titled Empirical 
        Evaluation. When you will add this section, make sure that you use the same structure 
        that you used for the M3 presentation (outlined above). Also, in your final document, 
        incorporate the feedback you received during previous Milestones, and the feedback you 
        received for M3.
        </p>
