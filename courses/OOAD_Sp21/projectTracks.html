                        <p> This class is project-based, and the project component bears the maximum percentage of the total points that students will accumulate for their final grade. 
                        <h1>For Undergrad students</h1>
                        <p>
                        In the first part, we will design and implement the Object business logic for Battleship game (the requirements
                        for Milestone 1 are <a href="https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/70627/files/28181261?wrap=1">here</a>). 
                        For every project Milestone (roughly every two weeks), we will give you new feature requests, 
                        which you will implement alongside your own features. The feature requests in the Milestones will 
                        help you make use of the OO Design Principles and Design Patterns that we cover in the class. 
                        In addition, you get to conduct continuous improvements on your design and code, through 
                        refactoring, peer reviews, producing professional-quality design documents 
                        (e.g.., UML class and sequence diagrams), etc. 

                        <h3>Last 6 weeks of the semester</h3>
                        <p><b>Option 1:</b> You have an option to stay with the Battleship game and make it more robust with features such as: adding GUIs, 
                        adding your own technology-layer architecture (e.g., making it web, native, or mobile app), 
                        add a controller logic (e.g., making it multi-player through networking, or 
                        adding an AI component that can play against a human player), and generally implement new cool features.
                        
                        <p><b>Option 2:</b> Choose your own project (technology, design, some code implementation).
                        Create a non-trivial set of classes and services that make use of some of the design patterns 
                        we cover to provide a nice set of functionality to the end-user; we like to see some UI design 
                        and data handling, but your project may vary.  You may use any languages, frameworks, libraries, 
                        or utilities for your project as long as the project demonstrates object-oriented design. 
                        
                        <p>While I am asking for a non-trivial project, you only have so much time.  Your team will have 
                        two weeks to do a thorough design, and then you will have about four weeks to develop your system 
                        prototype (2 iterations consisting of 2 weeks each). For sizing your work, during each iteration, 
                        each member of your group should expect to work to implement one to two use cases (possibly with 
                        other teammates).  As a result, if you are a member of a two-person team, you will want to 
                        target about 4-8 use cases for your system.  A    3-person team is looking at a 6-12 use cases 
                        (12 is a lot!).  You will detail this scope estimate in your initial design effort. 
                        
                        <p>Typical applications 
                        <ul>
  							<li>A Native or Multiplatform Mobile Application</li>
  							<li>A Responsive Web Application for Mobile Use</li>
  							<li> A Web Service Paired with a Mobile Client</li>
  							<li> A Cloud-based Application (using Student accounts for AWS, Google, Azure) with a Web or Mobile Interface (Think ahead on this one â€“ getting the cloud account can be a delay)</li>
  							<li> A Game for a specific platform (had some neat C#/Unity applications last time) </li>
  							<li> Other Client/Server Applications</li>
  							<li> An IoT style device or set of devices</li>
							</ul>


                        
                       <!-- Reminder on Project Scope Approach Project 4 asks you (and your team) to engage in analysis 
                        and design activities for your semester project.  You will generate a detailed set of tasks 
                        that can be accomplished with your proposed system and provide a comprehensive design of 
                        that system. The goal of these analysis and design activities is to generate information 
                        that will allow you to start implementing the system with confidence. While I am asking for 
                        a non-trivial amount of information, you should only generate the information you need to 
                        achieve your desired functionality given the size of your team.  You will have a about four 
                        weeks to develop your system (2 iterations consisting of about 2 weeks each). During each 
                        iteration, each member of your group should expect to work on one to two use cases (possibly
                         with other teammates). As a result, if you are a member of a two-person team, you'll want 
                         to target 4-8 use cases for your system. A 3-person team is looking at 6-12 use cases 
                         (12 is a lot!). Use these guidelines to scope the work of this assignment and really focus 
                         on generating information that will guide your implementation efforts during the last part 
                         of the semester. -->

                        <h1>For Grad students -- the Industry-novel Track 2</h1>
                        <p> In addition to the first 8 weeks working on the Battleship game designing and implementing 
                        the OO business logic, you will work on a research project that is industry-relevant.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The goal of novel-industrial work is to perform scholarly research on a topic related to 
                        object-oriented concepts, languages, frameworks, testing, principles, libraries, or patterns, or 
                        other uses of patterns in computer science (e.g. web, architecture, anti-patterns, etc.).  
                        Any type of research project is acceptable, including: analytic, argumentative, defining, 
                        compare/contrast, interpretive, experimental, or survey.  The topic may not be proprietary 
                        in any way, it must be able to be shared with reviewers and the class. You may also use this 
                        project to look at OO elements of your own research topics. This semester the research 
                        will be presented in the form of a research presentation (40 slides or more), optionally 
                        with accompanying software examples.  Please note it is expected to see incrementally
                         more thorough work from a three person team than from a two person team for these investigations. 
                         The first three project submissions will be via PDF.  The final three will use Microsoft PowerPoint.  
                         The Pecha Kucha presentation will be used in a classroom presentation and must be provided 
                         using timed Microsoft PowerPoint.

                        <p> You must complete a term project that is research-oriented and relates to the topic of this course. 
                        The project must relate to some aspect of Software Analysis and Design (e.g., empirical study, program analysis tool, program transformation tool, code development tool, etc). 
                        You should work in teams of two or three. I will spend time in class outlining what I think 
                        are interesting and feasible projects, though you have significant freedom in shaping them how
                        you please. The result will be a research paper that you can submit to an academic research conference. 
                        </p>

                      <h3> New research ideas proposed by the professor</h3>
                      <ul>
                      	<li> Automate a refactoring to improve some design aspect in an application domain of your choice (e.g., remove code smells in Python ML codebases)
                      	<li> Nowadays, centralized applications, written to run on a single node without accessing any cloud-based services, are in a minority. 
                      	Even the simplest of mobile applications access some remote services. However, the distribution decisions made at design time are often suboptimal. 
                      	For example, clients are often underutilized, while servers are overburdened (or the other way around). It would be nice to conduct a study to 
                      	examine how mobile/distributed apps use resources (both local and remote), identify the cases when the distribution decisions turn out suboptimal, 
                      	and then refactor the suboptimalities by hand, recording the required program transformations.
                        <li> Inspired/motivated from the findings in the above project, design an automated refactoring, e.g., Cloud Refactoring, to migrate client functionality to a cloud. Another project idea is the opposite refactoring, Component Insourcing, which migrates cloud functionality to a client.
						<li> Conduct an empirical study to find anti-patterns or code smells in an application domain of your choice (e.g., finding code smells in Python ML codebases)
