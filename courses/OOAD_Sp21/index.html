                          Welcome to CS361!
                          I am excited to teach this class.
                          We will be doing a few things differently from other classes to make CS361 more interactive and participatory.
                          You will have the opportunity to continuously share your opinions in class through NXT clicker and get instant feedback.
                          You will be engaged in an active learning environment where you learn from many sources, including your peers in class.
                          This term you will be doing extensive peer reviews (of code, design, documentation, etc.).
                          I will also interview in class (through Skype) some of the most famous industry leaders, book authors, and alumni.
                          You will be developing a project in Java and Eclipse using Test Driven Development.
                          You are expected to follow an organized software development process (eXtreme Programming) and ultimately deliver
                          a polished product with emphasis on good design, clean code, sufficient testing, and proper documentation.
                        </p>
