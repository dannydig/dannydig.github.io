                          Welcome to Object-Oriented Analysis & Design CSCI 4448/5448!
                          I am excited to teach this class.
                          We will be doing a few things differently from other classes to make OOAD more interactive and participatory.
                          You will have the opportunity to continuously share your opinions in class through  iClicker and get instant feedback.
                          You will be engaged in an active learning environment where you learn from many sources, including your peers in class.
                          <!--This term you will be doing extensive peer reviews (of code, design, documentation, etc.).-->
                          I will also interview in class (through Zoom) some of the most famous industry leaders, book authors, and alumni.
                          In the initial phase you will be developing a project in Java and IntelliJ IDEA using Test Driven Development, and in the second part you have a wide choice of technologies.
                          You are expected to follow an organized software development process (eXtreme Programming) and ultimately deliver
                          a polished product with emphasis on good design, clean code, sufficient testing, and proper documentation.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Course Learning Objectives</h2>
                        <p> Object-Oriented Analysis and Design is a course that presents an introduction 
                        to the design and construction of software systems using techniques that view a 
                        system as a set of objects that work together to realize the system's functionality. 
                        This perspective stands in contrast to more traditional "procedural" or "structured" 
                        design techniques that viewed systems as a set of procedures that manipulate shared 
                        data structures. Proponents of object-oriented techniques point to the flexibility and 
                        extensibility of object-oriented systems along with other benefits such as increased 
                        modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation.
                        </p>

                        <p>In this class, we will examine fundamental objected-oriented analysis and design techniques 
                        and show how decisions made during analysis and design impact the implementation of 
                        software systems. This class does not focus on object-oriented programming; however, 
                        we will examine many examples of object-oriented systems written in Java and other 
                        languages. A primary focus will be the understanding and application of key 
                        object-oriented principles and design patterns.
                        </p>

                          <li>Design software systems at an architectural level and at lower levels, using one or more techniques, such as object-oriented design or agile methods, and express these designs in design specification documents</li>
                          <li>Validate designs and adjust the specification or design as necessary</li>
                          <li>Participate effectively in the development of a project in a team environment</li>
