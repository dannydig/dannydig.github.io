                        <h1>Grading</h1>
                        <p>Grading will be based on total points accumulated from each type of assessment and assignment 
                        used in the class. All points from class activities have the same weight. A student earning 
                        less than 60% of the points possible will be given a failing grade. In all cases, grades 
                        may be assigned based on a curve determined by the instructor.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Make-up Exam Policy: No make-up exams are given except for medical or other 
                        similar hardships where advanced arrangements are made with the instructor; 
                        or in case of non-selective medical emergencies with physician’s note or 
                        documentation. Otherwise, <b>failure to take the exam at the scheduled time 
                        will result in a zero grade in the exam</b>.
                        
						<p>The overall course grade will be based on participation and attendance, homework/projects, quizzes, and exams. 
						The grade proportions are as follows (note they differ for graduate and undergraduate students):

                          grade. For more info, see the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Homework and Projects</h3>
						<p>Homework and related project assignments will be provided covering 
						material from class lectures. Students may collaborate on homework as presented 
						in homework details; a group of students collaborating on a homework may 
						turn in one group submission. All homework and reports must be legibly 
						written or typed and <u> must include the students name(s) in the 
						submission</u>. All homework assignments should be turned in at the due 
						date/time presented for the assignment on Canvas. Late homework 
						may be accepted but will be penalized as detailed in class or 
						assignment descriptions.
						
						<p>Code and reports are expected to be thorough work, including <u>proper references to any supporting materials</u>. 
						Whether working as a team or leveraging software designs from books, magazines, the Internet, 
						or other sources, <u>students are expected and required to cite and credit the source of the information clearly and completely</u>. 
						<b>Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be reported to the CU Honor Code Office.</b>

						<h3>Other Assessments</h3>
						<p>There will be scheduled quizzes most weeks over material presented; these will be provided via Canvas and will be performed outside of class. All quizzes must be completed prior to the Canvas due date/time. There will also be a mid-term and final examination. The quiz and exam assessments are to be done using individual effort alone. Mid-term and final exam logistics, times, and locations will be scheduled and announced.

						<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
						<p>From time to time, there may be opportunities for extra credit. Generally, 
						extra credit opportunities come from two sources – classroom activities (e.g., active participation in class discussions, 
						actively answering clarification questions on Piazza) and 
						project work. In most cases, classroom extra credit will supplement overall 
						quiz grades; all students will be given equivalent opportunities for extra 
						credit. Project extra credit will be described in project grading rubrics 
						and will be awarded for individual projects when projects are graded.

						<h1>Policies</h1>	
						
						<h3>Classroom Behavior</h3>
						<p>Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate 
						learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. 
						Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. 
						Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to 
						individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, 
						disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, 
						veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. 
						For more information, see the policies on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom behavior</a> and the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/">Student Code of Conduct</a>.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Requirements for Covid-19</h3>
                        All students and staff must adhere to the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/policies/covid-19-health-and-safety-policy">COVID-19 Health and Safety policies</a>. 
                                              
                        <h3>Accommodation for Disabilities</h3> 
                        <p>If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your 
                        accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner 
                        so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations 
                        based on documented disabilities in the academic environment. Information on 
                        requesting accommodations is located on the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/">Disability Services website</a>. 
                        Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or dsinfo@colorado.edu for 
                        further assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition, see 
                        <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions">Temporary Medical Conditions</a> on the Disability Services website.                     
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Preferred Student Names and Pronouns</h3>
						<p>CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information does not always align with how 
						they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student 
						portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. 
						In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the 
						student's legal name.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Honor Code</h3>
						<p>All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible 
						for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: 
						plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to 
						academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more 
						than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and 
						aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be 
						reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu); 303-492-5550). 
						Students found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will 
						be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic 
						sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the 
						Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code">Honor Code Office website</a>.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation</h3>
						The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to fostering an inclusive 
						and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate 
						acts of sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner 
						violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, or protected-class discrimination or 
						harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject 
						to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the 
						Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or 
						<a href="mailto:cureport@colorado.edu">cureport@colorado.edu</a>. Information about 
						the OIEC, university policies, <a href="https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PnqVK4kkIJIZnf">anonymous reporting</a>, and the campus resources can be found on the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/">OIEC website</a>.
						
						<p>Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC 
						when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, 
						stalking, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that 
						individuals impacted receive information about options for reporting and support resources.
						</p>
                        
                        <h3>Religious Holidays</h3>
						<p>Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every 
						effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious 
						obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required 
						attendance. In this class, please notify class staff two weeks ahead of 
						any planned absence. See the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams">campus policy regarding religious observances</a> for full details.
						</p>

						<h3>Use of Electronics in Class</h3>
						<p>You will need a connected phone, tablet, or laptop to participate in some classroom 
						activities. Cell phones (and other devices) need to be on silent and should be limited 
						in use to allow focus on material and to avoid disturbing fellow students. Connected devices, 
						such as laptops, may be used in class for taking notes.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Course Concerns</h3>
						<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the course, please discuss them with 
						the class staff as soon as possible. If we cannot address your concern, the issue 
						can be brought to the attention of the program advisors, faculty directors, 
						or department chairs.
						</p>
						
                        <h3>Late Assignment Policy</h3>
                        <p>
                          Homework assignments posted after the deadline, will be marked down
                          <b>50% the first day late and 25% for each day after the first late day</b>.
                          So for example, if the deadline for an assignment is at 11:59pm on Thursday, and
                          the assignment is submitted at 3:00am on Friday, it will will lose 50% of its graded value.
                          If the homework is submitted on Saturday at 12:00pm it will lose 75% of its graded value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you want to redo parts of your homework and take the late penalties, it is your responsibility to e-mail the TA.
                        </p>
                        
                        <!--<h3>No Laptop Policy</h3>
<p>Several studies and anecdotal experience shows that laptops are a distraction in the classroom - they disrupt learning, lower the performance of
students who use them, and even distract the other students. Here is an article that discusses some of the issues: <a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368">article1</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?np=y">article2</a>.
Students may not use laptops, cell phones, or other electronic devices in this classroom. If you expect this will pose an
undue hardship for your learning, please speak with the professor. </p>
-->

						<h3> Missing class because of illness, travel, emergency </h3>
						<p>If you are a student who is taking the synchronous section of the class, you can miss 
						  up to three classes without getting any penalty on your clicker
                          points. That is, when we compute your final score, we will drop the three lowest
                          clicker grades (e.g., we will not count the three times when you missed the
                          class and got zero points). As long as you don't miss too many classes, there
                          would not be a problem. This policy aims precisely at situations when people
                          travel for interviews, etc., so you don't have to explicitly contact course
                          staff for permission to miss a class. You still need to read the assigned reading for that day,
                          lecture notes, and turn in whatever is due at the right time.
                          </p>
