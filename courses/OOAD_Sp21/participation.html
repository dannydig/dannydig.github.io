                        <h1>Requirements and Format</h1>
                        <h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
                        <p>
                          Class lectures will start promptly at the scheduled class start time. 
                          Attendance at every class is required (for students taking the synchronous section of the class) 
                          as we will conduct individual 
                          and group classroom activities on Zoom, and students are encouraged to participate 
                          in activities and class discussions of course topics. Lectures will also 
                          be recorded and posted on the class Canvas site for later viewing. 
                          Because of the remote nature of this semester, participation will 
                          primarily be graded based on iClicker activity (for students attending synchronously) 
                          and Piazza contributions and comments (for students attending asynchronously). 
                          This will be detailed in class.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Given that there are no physical space constraints on Zoom, <b> students who are registered 
                        in the asynchronous sections of the class and whose schedule permits them to join the class synchronously, 
                        are allowed and even encouraged to attend the synchronous offering</b>. They will experience an increased sense
                        of community, which is important especially during these times of social distancing.  
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Class materials will be made available on Canvas along with any assignments. 
                        Students are expected to keep up with the course material and assignments as 
                        they are presented. If you fall behind, have personal issues which prevent 
                        participation, or need other help, schedule an appointment with the class 
                        staff as soon as possible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Students are expected to complete assignments on time, extensions to class 
                        assignment dates will be very rare. In some cases, project assignments will 
                        be accepted late, but the grade earned on the assignment will be reduced â€“ this 
                        allowance and reduction will be made clear for each assignment. Details of 
                        late policies will be reviewed in class as needed.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Canvas</h3>
                        <p>
                          Students must have access to and accounts for Canvas to find materials, get class notices, 
                          submit homework, and take quizzes and/or exams. I will use the announcements feature of 
                          Canvas for posting information on assignments and class changes. Please ensure you can 
                          reach the class Canvas site (<a href ="https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/70627">https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/70627</a>). 
                          You should ensure that you sign up in Canvas account settings for instant 
                          notifications of news, class schedule or assignment changes, content postings, 
                          assignment and quiz due dates, and grade updates.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Piazza</h3>
                        <p>
                        For messaging and postings of discussion materials, we will be using Piazza, 
                        which is available for the web as well as iOS and Android apps. 
                        Please sign up for your Piazza connection at: <a href="https://piazza.com/colorado/spring2021/csci44485448">piazza.com/colorado/spring2021/csci44485448</a>. 
                        The class staff will try to answer questions posted on Piazza as quickly as possible. 
                        We will also use Piazza for posting articles and links related to class subjects.
                        </p>    
                        
                        <h3>Remote Participation</h3>
                        <p>
                        Because of COVID-19 mitigation, the majority of contact in the class, including lectures, 
                        will be via Zoom conferencing. To join the class lectures synchronously, use the Zoom meeting
