                    <h1>Grad Project Milestone 2: Progress Update</h1>    
                        <p> This page is intended only for the Grad Students in the class (i.e., people registered for the CSCI 5448, sections 001 or 003). 
                        Make sure that you first familiarize yourself with the two Tracks, Industry-novel and Academic-novel, for the grad project (read <a href="./projectTracks.html">Project Tracks</a>).
                        
                        <ol>
                        
                        
                 <li>By now you should have started working on a solution to the problem and the research questions you proposed in Milestone 1. Take your previous document from Milestone 1, and add 2-3 pages describing::
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>a motivating example(s) section</b>. Typically this section contains some realistic code or design which presents the heart of the problem. You want to choose examples which are realistic (e.g., a simplified version of some real code from some open-source code), but they are also complex enough to illustrate the main challenges that your research is trying to solve. This section illustrates the What part of your solution, not the How part.
                        
                        <li> <b>a solution section</b>. Typically, this can include some pseudocode along with some English description or diagrams. You can reuse the motivating example, but now you present the HOW part of your solution. This section is expected to change until the end of the project, especially when you start to evaluate your project against many more real-world projects.

                    </ul>
                 
                    Use the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow" rel="nofollow">ACM SIG template</a> for preparing the document. Clearing indicate the names of the people on your team.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    You will also present in class your current progress. Cover the same points in the template above, you could even do a demo. 
                    Plan to talk for about 4 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
       
        <h3>Submission and Presentation Procedure</h3>
        <p> For the Presentation part, you need to submit a PDF file (you can use PowerPoint, OpenOffice, or Keynote, but please convert them to PDF) addressing the points in the templates above. 
        Submit the PDF on Canvas, <b>before 12PM on 04/02</b>. 
                        Afterwards, the professor will load all presentations on his laptop. 
                        Students will have <b>four minutes</b> on class on Friday (04/02) to present their project on Zoom (while the professor will share the slides from his laptop - this will eliminate valuable time lost in switching screen sharing on Zoom). 
                        For students who are not attending the live session of the class, please post the link to your self-recorded 4-minute video on the front page.
        <p> For the Paper using the ACM SIG template, please save the output in PDF and upload in Canvas too.  
        <p> Only one student from your whole team needs to submit in Canvas, and make sure that you list the name of everyone in the team on both PDFs.
