                        <h3 id="#clicker">What is the CU iClicker?</h3>
                        <p>
                         iClicker is an in-class student response system designed to better engage
                          students in the learning process and also provide instant feedback to the
                          student. Past research has shown the clicker to be very effective at improving
                          student/lecturer interactions, which in turn are known to improve student
                          learning (which is what we care about) and, consequently, student grades (what
                          you care about). For more information, please see <a href="clicker.html">this page</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="#points">Do I lose  iClicker points if I have to miss a class due to illness, interview, emergency?</h3>
                        <p>
                          You can miss up to three classes without getting any penalty on your clicker
                          points. That is, when we compute your final score, we will drop the three lowest
                          clicker grades (e.g., we will not count the three times when you missed the
                          class and got zero points). As long as you don't miss too many classes, there
                          would not be a problem. This policy aims precisely at situations when people
                          travel for interviews, etc., so you don't have to explicitly contact course
                          staff for permission to miss a class.
