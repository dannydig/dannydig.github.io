                    <h1>Grad Project Final Submission and Presentation</h1>    
                        <p> This page is intended only for the Grad Students in the class (i.e., people registered for the CSCI 5448, sections 001 or 003). 
                        Make sure that you first familiarize yourself with the two Tracks, Industry-novel and Academic-novel, for the grad project (read <a href="./projectTracks.html">Project Tracks</a>).
                        </p>
                        
             <h3>FINAL PROJECT</h3>
         <div>
             <p>
                 You turn in a document which looks like a completed research paper, which is ready to be submitted to a professional venue (e.g, an industry tradeshow or academic conference). In addition, you also present your work in class during the last two lectures (April 26 or April 28).
             </p>
             <p>
                 For the final document, please incorporate the feedback you received on M3 in class on April 16, and add new sections:
             </p>
             
            <ul>
                 <li>By now you should have a working solution. Take your previous document from Milestone 3, and add 2-3 pages describing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>ABSTRACT:</h5>
                            This should be punchy, intriguing, and stirring the interest of the reader to read the whole paper. 
                            You can achieve these goals by following the 
                            <a class="urllink" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OneStartlingSentence" rel="nofollow">Startling Sentence</a>
                            pattern.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
                            This should be a 1-2 page summary of the whole paper. It contains:
                            <ul>
                                <li>the higher-level motivation for the work (e.g. the importance and urgency of the problem you are trying to solve),</li>
                                <li>a brief description of the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art, the challenges that your solution must address.</li>
                                <li>a brief description of your solution</li>
                                <li>a brief description of the empirical evaluation and its main results</li>
                                <li>an explicit list of the contributions</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> 
                        	<h5>Empirical Evaluation</h5>
                        	When you will add this section, make sure that you use the same structure 
        that was outlined for the M3 presentation (see presentation bullets <a href="./gradMilestone3.html">here</a>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>RELATED WORK</h5>
                            We require at least 10 references. You need to compare and 
                            contrast your work to previous work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
                            This is a brief summary, but also contains the most surprising 
                            findings, implications, directions for future research.
                        </li>
                         <li>
                            <h5>LESSONS LEARNED</h5>
                            This is where you write a brief retrospective of your experience on working on the grad project in CSCI 5448. 
                            Each member of the team is required to write their own reflection points (which the team adds to the final document).
                        
                        In this Section please discuss some of these Reflections points:
(1) what went well in the project and in the future we should do more often
(2) did not go so well, in the future we should change
(3) what still puzzles us.
(4) what were the main lessons we learned by working on the grad project.
                        </li>
                        When you write this final project report make sure that the whole paper reads cohesive, like it's written by one author (instead of a committee), 
                            so you will need to smoothen the transition between the previously written sections, etc.
                    </ul>
            </ul>
                   
                <h3>HAND-IN:</h3>
                <p> The team does a final presentation in class on either Mon (April 26) or Wed (April 28). Each team has 7 minutes for the presentation. Sign-up sheets will be available here soon. 
                When you present, follow the style of the presentation modeled by Prof Dig when he presented Type Change Refactoring in class on Wed, April 14th. 
                To expedite the presentation transitions, each team should submit a PDF version of the Presentation (you can use PowerPoint, OpenOffice, or Keynote, but please convert them to PDF). 
                on Canvas, <b>before 1PM on 04/26</b>. 
                        Afterwards, the professor will load all presentations on his laptop. 
                        Students will have <b>seven minutes</b> on class on to present their project on Zoom (while the professor will share the slides from his laptop - this will eliminate valuable time lost in switching screen sharing on Zoom). 
                        For students who are not attending the live session of the class, please post the link to your self-recorded 7-minute video on the front page.
                <p>The final paper is due on Thu, April 29 at midnight. You can use the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/72548fda518a0db8cb14a10becfee4c5763418d3.pdf">Type Migration Refactoring paper (published at ICSE'19)</a> that Professor Dig presented in class on April 14 as a model for how technical writing should look like.
                <p> Only one student from your whole team needs to submit in Canvas, and make sure that you list the name of everyone in the team on both PDFs.                          

        
               <h3>NOTES:</h3>
        <p>
        In your final document, incorporate the feedback you received during previous Milestones, and the feedback you 
        received for M3 on Friday, April 16.
