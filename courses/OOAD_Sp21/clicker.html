                        <h1>CU iClicker for students attending the live lectures</h1>
                        <h3>What is an iClicker?</h3>
                        <p>
                          iClicker is an in-class student response system designed to better engage
                          students in the learning process and also provide instant feedback to the
                          student. Past research has shown the clicker to be very effective at improving
                          student/lecturer interactions, which in turn are known to improve student
                          learning (which is what we care about) and, consequently, student grades (what
                          you care about).
                        </p>

                        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                        <p>
                          Each student uses a "clicker" web account (called iClicker Reef) that allows her or
                          him to vote on professor's questions by clicking on the appropriate answer choice. 
                          iClicker Reef is software students can use to review clicker questions and answers, 
                          as well as vote in a remote learning environment. 
                          Students can use iClicker Reef on their mobile device or computer. 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The results are gathered instantly and the professor can display results in a
                          graph in class, or refer them later for analysis, grading, etc.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
                        <p>
                          We want you to learn more and enjoy the class and research suggests clickers can help:
                          <ul>
                          <li>Students come to class more often when clickers are used (Cue, 1998; Jackson &amp; Trees, 2003; Cadwell, 2007)</li>
                          <li>A majority of students enjoy using clickers (Simpson &amp; Oliver, 2006; Stowell &amp; Nelson, 2007)</li>
                          <li>Students are more alert and interested in class (Burnstein &amp; Lederman, 2001; Preszler, Dawe, Schuster, &amp; Schuster, 2007)</li>
                          <li>Student get higher final grades when clickers are used (Freeman et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2006)</li>
                          <li>Students do better on tests (Caraghan &amp; Webb, 2005; Crossgrove &amp; Curran, 2008; Suchman et al., 2006)</li>
                          <li>Students retain more information from lecture (Cambell &amp; Meyer, 2008; Luke et al., 2010; Mun, Hew &amp; Cheung, 2008; Pradhan et al. 2005)</li>
                          <li>Information is retained longer (Luke et al., 2010)</li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Where to get it?</h3>
                        <p> For the Spring 2021 semester, CU students do not need to purchase an iClicker Reef subscription to use mobile polling. Create a <a href="https://oit.colorado.edu/node/24881">free iClicker Reef account</a> now!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          An iClicker Reef account is required for your iClicker grade to count.
                        </p>
                        <p> <a href="https://oit.colorado.edu/tutorial/cuclickers-using-iclicker-reef-class">Find and Register for your courses</a>. Follow the instructions in this tutorial. When you search for course, please use "Object Oriented Analysis and Design" in the search field.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How do I get points?</h3>
                        <p>
                          Credit is given for responses (right or wrong), with points for each lecture.
                          The number of lectures in which the clicker is used is N, but you will be graded on only N-3: the lowest three grades will be dropped.
                          Your clicker grade is then the sum of your points.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Each lecture is worth 2 points.
                          Students get 1 point for "participation" and 0.25 performance points for each correct answer with a maximum of 1 performance point / lecture.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How do I link it with Canvas?</h3>
                        <p>
                          Notice that due to a technical glitch (we notified OIT) you cannot yet link it with Canvas. Once we announce that this was fixed, you will need to <a href="https://oit.colorado.edu/tutorial/cuclickers-sync-your-iclicker-reef-account-canvas">link your iClicker Reef with Canvas for the class</a>.
                          <!--You will still need to bring the clicker to the first class - it will work even without being registered.-->
                        </p>
                        <p><b>
                          The deadline to link your iClicker Reef with Canvas is Fri, Jan 22nd (assuming that OIT solves the integration problem by then).
                          You will loose all previously accumulated points if you don't register your device by Jan 22nd. 
                        </b></p>
