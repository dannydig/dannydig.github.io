        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <div>
            <p>We will have two papers discussed per meeting. Each student need to read 
            all assigned papers and write reports. 
            <!--but write only one paper critique. You can choose any of the 
            papers listed for that meeting. -->
            However, if you are presenting in a given 
            meeting, you need not write a report for any of the other papers. </p>
            
            <p>
                Students should critique the papers to be discussed in class. Do not directly 
                copy the abstract, introduction, conclusion or any other part of the paper - you 
                must add value and insight beyond what is already in the paper. 
                Unless specified otherwise, all paper critiques are due by 12pm the day of the respective class 
                and should address the following questions (inspired from this excellent resource on how to <a class='urllink' href='http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html' rel='nofollow'>Read an Engineering Research paper</a> by William Griswold): 
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>1. What I liked</h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                What is your analysis of the identified problem, idea and evaluation? Is this a good
                idea? What are the most interesting points made? What are the most controversial ideas
                or points made? For work that has practical implications, you also want to ask: Is this
                really going to work, who would want it, what it will take to give it to them, and when
                 might it become a reality?
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>2. What I disliked</h4>
        <div>
            <p>What flaws do you perceive in the work?
                </p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>3. Future directions for this research</h4>
        <div>
            <p>Not only what future directions do the authors identify, but what ideas did you come up with 
            while reading the paper? Sometimes these may be identified as shortcomings or other critiques 
            in the current work. Examples include, but are not limited to: Can the same problem have a different 
            solution? Can the same solution be applied to a different problem? Would a bigger evaluation be appropriate?
            </p>
        </div>
               
        <h4>4. Open questions</h4>
        <div>
            <p>What questions are you left with? What questions would you like to raise in an open discussion of the work?
            What do you find confusing or difficult to understand? By taking the time to list several, you will be forced
            to think more deeply about the work.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>5. Summary</h4>
        <div>
            What is your take-away message from this paper? Sum up the main implication of the paper from your perspective.
            This is useful for very quick review and refreshing your memory. It also forces you to try to identify the essence
            of the work.
        </div>
        
        
        <h3> OPTION TWO: Tool Experience Report</h3> 
        <p> Some students gain more insights using experiential learning: read a paper, download the tool, and use it for your own usecase. Then write a Tool Experience Report -- instead of the Paper Critique format outlined above. After using the tool, write a 1-page, concise reflection on using the tool introduced by the research paper, following this format:
 
 <h4>1. Your Experience Using the Tool</h4>

What specific task(s) did you perform with the tool?
How easy or difficult was it to install, set up, and use?
Did the tool behave as described in the paper? Mention any differences or surprises you found.

<h4>2. Strengths</h4>

What are the strongest aspects of this tool (e.g., accuracy, usability, speed, integration, insights)?
What features or design choices did you find especially effective or well thought out?

<h4>3. Weaknesses</h4>

What limitations or challenges did you encounter (e.g., poor documentation, installation issues, narrow scope, inaccurate results)?
Were there any tasks or contexts where the tool performed poorly or failed to meet expectations?

<h4>4. Potential for Practical Impact</h4>

How could this tool influence software engineering practice if adopted widely?
What types of developers, teams, or companies would most benefit from it?
What barriers to adoption (e.g., trust, policy, scalability) might stand in the way?

<h4>5. Reflection and Recommendations</h4>

What did you learn from using the tool that you wouldn’t have learned from reading the paper alone?
What one improvement would you recommend to the tool’s creators?
        
        
        
        <h3>Submission Procedure</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Submit your paper critique by 12pm on the day of the class on Canvas. By sending your questions earlier than the class time, the presenter will have time to find some other relevant materials that are addressing your questions. Thus, the presenter will be able to better serve you.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Paper critique policies</h3>
        <div>
            <ul><li>Students are welcome to discuss the papers even before writing the report, but reports should be written individually. CSCI 7000-005 uses the standard ethics code for CS courses.
            </li><li>Reports are due by 12pm MST on the day of the class (submitting earlier is OK and encouraged)
            </li><li>You can't have any paper critique sent late; if you need an extension, ask in advance, and you may be assigned a make-up paper.
            </li></ul>
