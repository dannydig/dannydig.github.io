            <ul><li>what is the problem you are trying to solve?
            </li><li>why is the problem important to solve?
            </li><li>what is the current state-of-the-practice or state-of-the-art in solving this problem, and what are its limitations?
            </li><li>what is your proposed solution?
            </li><li>how would you convince the professor, classmates, and the research community that your solution is successful?
