            <P><Strong>SHORT BIO</Strong> <BR>
            Danny Dig is an associate professor of computer science at the University of Colorado, 
            and an adjunct professor at University of Illinois and Oregon State. 
 He enjoys doing research in Software Engineering, with a focus on 
 interactive program transformations that improve programmer productivity and software quality. 
 He successfully pioneered interactive program transformations by opening the field of refactoring 
 in cutting-edge domains including AI/ML, mobile, concurrency and parallelism, component-based, testing, and end-user programming.
 He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where his research
 won the best Ph.D. dissertation award, and the First Prize at the ACM
 Student Research Competition Grand Finals. He did a postdoc at MIT.
  
 <P>He (co-)authored 60+ journal and conference papers that appeared in top
 places in SE/PL. According to Google Scholar his publications have been
 cited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z9MS0rEAAAAJ&hl=en">6200+ times</a>. His group's research was recognized with 9 paper awards at the flagship and top conferences in SE (FSE'17, OOPSLA'17, ICSME'17, FSE'16, ICSE'14, ISSTA'13, ICST'13, ICSME'15), 
 4 award runner-ups, and 1 most influential paper award (N-10 years) at ICSME'15, and 3 winners of the ACM Student Research Competition. He received the NSF CAREER award, the Google Faculty Research Award (twice), 
 and the Microsoft Software Engineering Innovation Award (twice).
 His research group released dozens of software systems, among them the
 world's first open-source refactoring tool. 
 Some of the techniques they developed are shipping with the
 official release of the popular Eclipse, NetBeans, Visual Studio, Android Studio development
 environments and are used daily by millions of software developers. 
 He has started two popular workshops: Workshop on Refactoring Tools, and
 Hot Topics On Software Upgrades, both had at least five instances. He
 chaired or co-organized 14 workshops and 1 conference (MobileSoft'15), 
 and served as a member of 40+ program committees for all top conferences in his area. He is grateful for
 research funding from NSF, Boeing, IBM, Intel, Google, Microsoft, NEC, and Trimble.
 <P><STRONG>RESEARCH INTERESTS</STRONG><BR>
            Successful software undergoes constant change. Our research addresses two important questions: 
            <OL>
            <LI>What changes occur most often in practice? 
            <LI>How can we automate them to improve programmers' productivity and software quality? 
             </LI></OL>
          Over the years we have successfully automated program transformations to (i) retrofit parallelism into sequential code, (ii) improve responsiveness of mobile apps, (iii) upgrade component-based applications, (iv) update obsolete tests, (v) make end-user programs easier to change, and (vi) improve productivity of ML engineers.<BR>
          <P>General interests:- <strong>automated refactoring</strong>, interactive program analysis and transformation, 
          design & architectural patterns, and broadly interested in <strong>concurrency and parallelism, mobile computing</strong>, software development processes, program analysis, software testing, and software evolution </P>
